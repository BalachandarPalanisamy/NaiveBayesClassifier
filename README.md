What is Naïve Bayes?	
Bayesian classifiers are statistical classifiers which is based on Bayes’ theorem. They can predict class membership probabilities, such as the probability that a given sample belongs to a particular class. This assumption is called class conditional independence. It is made to simplify the computation involved and, in this sense, is considered ‘Naive’.

Naïve Bayes is a simple form of classifier in field of machine learning. 
Naïve Bayesian classifiers assume that the effect of an attribute value on a given class is independent of the values of the other attributes. This can be used to identify of how variables are related to one another and come up with conditional independence assumptions that make it computationally tractable to estimate the joint distribution. 
Naive Bayes model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets. Along with simplicity, Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods.
